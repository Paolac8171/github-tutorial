  "body": "# GitHub Tutorial Project\r\n\r\n## _Overview_  \r\n\r\n* Using markdown syntax, display all of your knowledge about **Git** and **Github** in a single README file.  \r\n\r\n## _Directions_\r\n\r\n1. Fork and clone this repository.\r\n2. Notice there are two files:  \r\n    a. `README.md` is where you will find a template to use as a starting point for your tutorial.  This is where you'll do your work.  \r\n    b. `directions.md` is where you will find these directions.\r\n3. As you edit, make a commit every once in a while.  Don't forget to push!  \r\n4. When you are finished, submit your remote repository URL (see class website).  \r\n\r\n## _Topics_\r\n\r\n* git vs github overview\r\n  * explain what each is, and the difference between the two\r\n  * [10%]\r\n* one-time setup\r\n  * github account, SSH key, `git config` (user.name & user.email)\r\n  * [15%]\r\n* repo setup\r\n  * `init`, your first `add` & `commit`, new repo on github, remote\r\n  * [20%]\r\n* ongoing workflow & commands\r\n  * status, add, commit, push\r\n  * [40%]\r\n\r\n_NOTE: for each command, you should explain:_\r\n\r\n* what each command does (explain the concept)\r\n* how to actually use it (correct syntax)\r\n\r\n## _Other Requirements_\r\n\r\n* use MD syntax _(headings, bold, italics, etc)_\r\n  * [5%]\r\n* use list(s) _(ordered and/or unordered)_\r\n  * [5%]\r\n* use code snippets _(single and/or multi-line)_\r\n  * [5%]\r\n\r\n### _Extra Credit_\r\n\r\n* error handling\r\n  * what to do if you did `init` in the wrong directory  \r\n  * how to completely remove a repository (local & remote)  \r\n  * [10%]  \r\n* collaboration  \r\n  * fork & `clone`, pull requests and `pull`  \r\n  * [10%]  \r\n\r\n---\r\n### A note about plagiarism\r\nYou should be typing _every single word_.  It is ok to refer to your notes, the slides, the internet, and even your classmates for help.  However, **intellectual property is to be regarded highly in this class**.  You should be explaining everything in your own words.  If you are copying/pasting, you are not learning.\r\n\r\n### Final thoughts\r\nThe best way to learn something is through repeated practice.  \r\nFeel free to **practice** all of these concepts on your own to understand them better.  \r\nDon't forget to use [Google](http://www.google.com) if you get stuck!",
