<ul>
<li>The difference between Git and GitHub is that<br>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Git</strong> is a version control that runs in the commandline , it allows you to track and save changes in a project .</li>
<li>
<strong>Github</strong> is the site that allows you to store these changes remotely for later viewing </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They both work with each other in order to keep track of changes, but while Git allows you to keep track of changes within your local repository , Github holds these changes in a remote repository .<br>
</li>
</ul>

<a id="initial-setup" class="anchor" href="#initial-setup" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Initial Setup</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In order to make a github account you need to sign up using your current email and a password which can be easily remembered . </p>

<ul>
<li>After you have created your account on github , github will want to verify your accounts authenticity through an email that you need to reply to in the steps directed . </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>In github and c9.io , the SSH key is used to connect the accounts and allow a smooth interchangable use of both accounts. In order to set up this connection you need to go into your github account and go into settings in order to find the tab that displays <code>SSH and GPG keys</code> , you will click on this tab and name it . Afterward , you will go into your c9 account , click on your personal icon and paste the code given for your key in github into the <code>SSH keys</code> in . </p></li>
<li>In github, an SSH key is also used when cloning or downloading another users project . This key is used so that your account on github is remembered each time you go to work into the users project . The use of this key takes away the burden of having to verify your account every time you go to work inside of the other users project.

<a id="repository-setup" class="anchor" href="#repository-setup" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Repository Setup</h2>

<ul>
<li>In order to setup a repository on your c9 account, you begin by going into your home directory through the use of <code>cd ~/workspace</code> . Then you can create your repository through the use of <code>mkdir</code> , which you add with your repositories name , for example, <code>mkdir first-repo</code> . Afterward, you want to go into your repository through the use of <code>cd first-repo</code>. </li>
<li>Your next steps are to initialize git within your repository . By intializing git, you are in a sense , turning on the program that allows you to save the changes you make within a directory.
